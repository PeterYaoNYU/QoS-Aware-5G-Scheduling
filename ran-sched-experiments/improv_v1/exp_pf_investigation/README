to further investigate why the score of the PF metric is irregular, we. 
1. Change the flow for the pf slice to backlogged flow, and evaluate the variance of the per UE throughput
2. Compare the per UE throughput when the inter slice scheduler is MLWDF/MT/PF


3. Also investigate whether the HoL blocking for MLWDF slice is consistent with its score when the inter slice scheduler is different
